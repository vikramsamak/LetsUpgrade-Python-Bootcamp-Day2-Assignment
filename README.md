# Student Grading Program

This is a simple Python program that calculates grades for students based on their marks. It uses if-elif-else statements for grading and handles potential errors in user input. The program allows the user to calculate grades for multiple students until they decide to exit.

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment.
2. Enter the marks obtained by the student (0-100).
3. The program will display the corresponding grade.
4. Choose whether to calculate grades for another student.

## Grading Scale
- 90 or above: A+
- 80 to 89: A
- 70 to 79: B
- 60 to 69: C
- 50 to 59: D
- Below 50: Fail

## Note
- Ensure valid numeric input for marks.
- Input 'yes' to continue calculating grades; otherwise, the program will exit.
